Exoplanet Data Analysis and Cleaning

Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing and cleaning data from NASA’s Kepler Mission, which aims to survey our region of the Milky Way to discover Earth-sized and potentially habitable planets. The mission’s data provides insights into the diversity and structure of planetary systems.

The project includes:

	•	Cleaning raw exoplanet data from the Kepler mission.
	•	Conducting exploratory data analysis to uncover patterns and insights.
	•	Preparing a structured dataset for further analysis, such as modeling or statistical exploration.

Data Source
